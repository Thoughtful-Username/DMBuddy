Iâ€™m developing DM Buddy, a Python application to assist Dungeon Masters with Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition, focusing on an initiative tracker for combat encounters. The app manages in-game information, dice rolling, and option selections, with extensibility for future features (e.g., campaign management). Below is the current Project Structure Outline (PSO) and design notes. Please provide feedback on:

- **Priority for the current prompt**: Provide prioritized list of programming concept to decide on, to ensure that the appropriate framework is in place as code development begins, to minimize back-tracking.
- **Python Coding Best Practices**: Suggest improvements for OOP, modularity, error handling, and testing. Include code snippets for key concepts (e.g., dependency injection, type hinting).
- **D&D 5e Mechanics**: Ensure the design aligns with 5e rules (e.g., action economy, initiative, conditions, creature statblocks). Identify discrepancies and suggest corrections with examples.

**Attachments**:

- PSO: [Text file. Copied below.]
- Coding Requirements: [Included below PSO]
- Project concepts: [Included below Coding Requirements]

**Constraints**:

- I have basic Python/OOP knowledge and want to learn professional practices (e.g., testing, documentation).
- The app is for personal use but should follow formal project structure.

**Desired Output**:

- Bullet points or sections for each focus area.
- Code snippets for Python suggestions.
- Concise, actionable advice tailored to my skill level.
