I’m developing DM Buddy, a Python application to assist Dungeon Masters with Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition, focusing on an initiative tracker for combat encounters. The app manages in-game information, dice rolling, and option selections, with extensibility for future features (e.g., campaign management). Below is the current Project Structure Outline (PSO) and design notes. Please provide feedback on:

- **Priority for the current prompt**: Provide prioritized list of programming concept to decide on, to ensure that the appropriate framework is in place as code development begins, to minimize back-tracking.
- **Python Coding Best Practices**: Suggest improvements for OOP, modularity, error handling, and testing. Include code snippets for key concepts (e.g., dependency injection, type hinting).
- **D&D 5e Mechanics**: Ensure the design aligns with 5e rules (e.g., action economy, initiative, conditions, creature statblocks). Identify discrepancies and suggest corrections with examples.


**Attachments**:
- PSO: [Text file.  Copied below.]
- Coding Requirements: [Included below PSO]
- Project concepts: [Included below Coding Requirements]

**Constraints**:
- I have basic Python/OOP knowledge and want to learn professional practices (e.g., testing, documentation).
- The app is for personal use but should follow formal project structure.

**Desired Output**:
- Bullet points or sections for each focus area.
- Code snippets for Python suggestions.
- Concise, actionable advice tailored to my skill level.

│                                                 Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition game.  First and
│                                                 foremost intended to assist with in-game information
│                                                 management, option selections, dice-rolling, etc.  My
│                                                 first idea was I need an 'initiative tracker' so that
│                                                 during complex encounters, turn management is controlled,
│                                                 valid actions are clearly defined, and temporary effects
│                                                 are administered.  The concept of this project grew from

**Coding requirements**:
 - Maintain compliance with PEP8, with the exception of the 79-character-per-line limit.  Code will
   be formatted at a later date to come into compliance with that particular requirement.
 - Employ efficiency-, extensibility-, and robustness-ensuring coding concepts, including: class-level
   data caching, data file validation, dependency injections, type hinting, etc.  TODO: identify other
   important concepts.
 - Use preferred libraries: json, jsonschema, logging, pytest, re, tkinter, typing, etc. TODO: Define
   other preferred libraries.




**Projects concepts**:
 - Action (class)
   - An action is any activity that is available to a Creature.
    - During combat encounters, actions are taken on a turn-by-turn basis sorted by the combatants' initiative roll.
    - Outside of combat, actions are more loosely limited.
    - Whether in combat or not, outside factors can influence the ability to attempt an action and whether such an
      attempt will succeed.
   - Typically, actions available to a monster are pre-defined by the monster's statblock.  The DM has the latitude
     to change, add or subtract actions a monster has available to them, but for this project, that is a long-term consideration.
   - Actions available to characters come from a few sources:
    - 'Standard' actions available in combat, such as 'disengage', 'ready', 'utilize', etc.  For this project,
      'attack' is left off of this list for the reason described below.
    - Some actions are available to a character based on their race and some are available based on class and level.
    - Some actions are only available to a character based on items they have equipped and/or attuned.
     - As an example, a character can only attack with a club if they have a club equipped.
     - This is the reason that 'attack' won't appear on the 'standard' action list.
   - Actions have several components:
    - Name (e.g. 'Melee attack with sword', 'Ranged attack with crossbow', 'Cast Firebolt', etc.).
    - Description (optional).
    - Success chance based on 'to hit' rolls against AC, DC saves, etc.
    - Effects.  Effects are applied based on the game rules but typically when an action succeeds.  Effects are implemented
      in this project as described below.
   - JSON files defining actions will contain some sort of field codes to allow for customization.  So, for example,
     there would be a single action with the name field containing 'Melee attack with {weapon.name}', rather than hardcoding every case.
 - Creature (base class)
   - Contains attributes and logic universal to characters, monsters, and NPCs
   - All activities carried out by the class are at the direction of the session manager module.
   - Character (subclass)
     - Specialized logic for:
       - Death (death saves)
       - Inventory Management
       - Classes and Levelling
       - Allowance for manual dice rolling or automatic
       - Available actions
       - Other?
   - Monster (subclass)
     - Specialized logic for:
       - Death (monsters die at 0 HP)
       - Lore
       - Tactics
       - Encounter Creation
       - Loot
       - Other?
   - NPC (subclass)
     - Combination of Character and Monster logic
 - Effect (class)
   - An effect generates from:
     - Attuning items
     - Creature attributes (such as AC bonus based on dexterity)
     - Equipping items
     - Successful actions
     - Using items
     - Other things?
   - Effects temporarily or permanently add, modify, or remove attributes of a Creature.
     - Temporary effects can persist based on action counts or turn counts or can be instantaneous with no
       persistence.
     - Permanent effects can be simply permanent, permanent until dispelled, or permanent so long as an item is
       equipped or attuned.
   - Instances of Effect are observers of the actions of Creatures and update themselves
     based on those actions.  Some effects may need to observe other things (like a spell-caster's concentration).
 - Initiative Controller
